# FractureAI 🩺✨

## Overview 🌟

**FractureAI** is a smart web application that helps doctors find and understand fractures in X-ray images. It uses advanced technology to analyze the images, highlight the broken bones, and create detailed reports about the fractures. This tool makes it easier for healthcare professionals to diagnose and treat patients quickly and accurately. FractureAI is user-friendly, allowing anyone to upload images and get instant results without needing technical knowledge.

## Features 🌈

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple design to upload and analyze images.
- **Fast Fracture Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 for quick identification of fractures.
- **Detailed Analysis Reports**: Generates reports with insights about detected fractures.
- **Supports Multiple Users**: Efficiently handles many users at once without delays.
